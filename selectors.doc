        matches nested <li>
        
    ol > li
        child Selector
        matches <li> in <ol> but not nested ul
    
    li.myClass + li
        adjacent sibling
    
    NEW!!!
    li.myClass ~ li
        general sibling Selector
        matches later siblings, but not nested.

ATTRUBUTE Selectors

OLDER ATTRUBUTE Selectors
    E[attr]
        element E that has the attribute attr with any value
    E[attr='val']
        element E that has the attribute attr with the exact, case-sensitive if attribute is case sensitive, value val.

    E[attr|=val]
        Element E whose attribute attr has a value val or begins with val- ('val' plus "-")

    E[attr~=val]
        Element E whose attribute attr has within its value the space separated full word val.

    E[attr^=val]
        Element E whose attribute attr starts with the value val.

    E[attr$=val]
        Element E whose attribute attr ends in val
    
    E[attr*=val]
        Element E whose attribute attr matches val anywhere within the attribute. Similar to E[attr~=val] above except the val can be a part of a word.
